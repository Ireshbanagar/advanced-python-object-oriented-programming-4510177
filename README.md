In this advanced course, Miki Tebeka, the CEO at 353Solutions, guides you through object-oriented programming features in Python. Learn about attribute access and how to use properties, name mangling, descriptors, and more. Explore using class methods, static methods, mixin classes, and abstract base classes. Dive into sequences, mappings, numbers, and callable types. Find out what metaclasses are and how you can use them. Plus, go over class creation utilities that you’ll need to use. Each chapter comes with a hands-on challenge to practice and reinforce what you learn.</p>

<p>The best way to learn a language is to use it in practice. That’s why this course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the “Using GitHub Codespaces with this course” video to learn how to get started.
